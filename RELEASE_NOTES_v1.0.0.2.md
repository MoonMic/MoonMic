## ðŸ”’ Security Improvements
- **Removed exposed GitHub token** - Revoked and replaced with secure SSH authentication
- **Cleaned repository** - No more exposed credentials in git history
- **Fixed security workflow** - GitHub Actions now properly excludes workflow files from token detection

## ðŸ“‹ Changes Made
- Updated manifest version to 1.0.0.2
- Removed `storage` permission from manifest.json (was unused)
- Fixed GitHub Actions workflow to exclude itself from security scans
- Set up secure SSH authentication for repository access

## ðŸŽ¯ Chrome Web Store Compliance
